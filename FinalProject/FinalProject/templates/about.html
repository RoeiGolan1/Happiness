    <p class="have">
        The project is part of the "data science" profession of the 10th grade students of the Alterman High School in Tel Aviv.
        <br /> <br />
        The project combines two main areas of knowledge:
        <br /> <br />
        * Programming in the web environment
        <br />
        * Data Science
        <br /> <br />
        As part of the project, I located databases on the network and intend to build around them a website that allows access to the databases, data analysis and presentation to users in a convenient way. The site will allow the user to explore the data in the chosen field and try to reach valuable insights and conclusions.
        <br /> <br />
        The project will be based on the following technological components:
        <br /> <br />
        * Python language.
        <br />
        * Pandas Library.
        <br />
        * Flask infrastructure for building a web server.
